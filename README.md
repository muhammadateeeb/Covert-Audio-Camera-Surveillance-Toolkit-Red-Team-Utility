# Covert Audio & Camera Surveillance Toolkit

## Overview
This Python-based surveillance toolkit is designed for **red team operations**, **penetration testing**, and **cybersecurity research**. It enables covert audio recording and webcam image capture from target machines, with real-time data exfiltration over TCP to a controlled command-and-control (C2) server.
